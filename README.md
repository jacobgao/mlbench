# mlbench

This is the repo for our recursion as well as benchmarking projects that are likely involved with the following systems:
* SimSQL (recursion and benchmarking)
* TensorFlow (recursion and benchmarking)
* Spark (benchmarking)
* SystemML (benchmarking)

and models:
* Deep neural networks (feed-forward, recurrent, ...)
* Hidden Markov models
* Latent Dirichlet allocation (collapsed and non-collapsed)

and other benchmarking experiments to add.

Now get the ball rolling... :coffee:
